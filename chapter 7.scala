/**
  7.4 Why do you think the Scala language designers provided the package object syntax instead of simply letting you add functions and variables to a package?
**/

// Because a package could be huge. Creating objects makes you gather variables and methods that logically belong together into smaller units.

/**
  7.5 What is the meaning of private[com] def giveRaise(rate: Double)? Is it useful?
**/

// It makes the method private to the package com. Yes, it is useful to have private methods that cannot be accessed from the outside.
// In pure Functional thinking one should minimize state though, so the number of these methods that are needed should be small.
